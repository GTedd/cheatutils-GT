        Uses liquid flows (water and lava) to determine if chunk is newly generated. Chunk status is displayed on Exploration Mini Map.<br>
        Red squares - old chunks (chunks contains non-source water/lava blocks)<br>
        Green squares - new chunks (chunk didn't have non-source water/lava blocks, but server sent block update packets with non-source water/lava)<br>
        Yelllow squares - relatively new chunks (chunk already had non-source water/lava, but new non-source water/lava blocks appeared)<br>
        Chunk without square - there is no water/lava to guess chunk status
